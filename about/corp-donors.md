# Corporate and Foundation Donors

## Linux Fund
Kids on Computers at one time received a donation of several dozen laptops. They were older model laptops and, although they functioned well, they had insufficient memory (RAM) to run our chosen Linux OS efficiently. A donation from LinuxFund.org allowed us to find and purchase memory boards compatible with these older laptops. We upgraded the memory, installed Linux and our applications and the laptops were soon placed in school labs.

LinuxFund.org provides financial and administrative support to the open source community throughout the world.
