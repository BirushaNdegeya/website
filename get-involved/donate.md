How is your money being spent?

Your cash donation goes entirely into our general fund. From that fund we purchase computer parts for upgrading or refurbishing computers that have been donated. If computer equipment donations don’t provide essential parts for a computer lab, we then have to purchase what we need. We also must pay for shipping computers and computer parts from wherever a donor delivers them to wherever they are needed.
