San Fernando is a partido, or an administrative jurisdiction, of Buenos Aires province in Argentina.

The [Virreyes Rugby Club](https://www.facebook.com/VirreyesRC/) in Partido de San Fernando had set up an after-school club, making computers available to children for educational and job search purposes.

A Kids on Computers volunteer from Colorado traveled to Partido de San Fernando in early 2010. She and several others in her MBA class carried thirty laptops to establish the lab. A local Intel Corporation facility had donated the laptops; the class and KoC volunteers did the fundraising to purchase hard drives.
