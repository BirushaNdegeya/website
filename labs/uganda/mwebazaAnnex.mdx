Each workstation is a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Raspbian and includes applications like GCompris, Tux Math, Tux Typing, Libre Office, and other educational software.

**January 2020 Update:**

> The school is located in Nkungulutale and it runs from nursery section to primary two.
> 
> Kids in the nursery section at this school are not all that good in as far as computing is concerned however some kids in this section can identify some of the hardware components  like a monitor, mouse and a keyboard, they can even power on and off the computers by themselves  and they can operate some games in the child play program.
> 
> The kids in the section of P.1 and P.2 at MWAN
> 
> Under this section we are moving at a abit slow pase because the kids here are abit slow learners and this makes me to stick on some points for some time but by the end of last term they were able to identify all the hardware components, tux paint, educational suite g comprises on some games among others.
