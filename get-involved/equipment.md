title: Computer Equipment
---


In addition to cash donations, we also accept donations of Raspberry Pis and modern laptops. Equipment should be in good working order and modern enough to run current desktop software.  If we are able to accept your donation, Kids on ComputersÂ® will provide a receipt for donated equipment.

### Raspberry Pis

Over the last few years, we have started setting up Raspberry Pis in our labs. We often purchase these in bulk using cash donations, but if you are able to provide hardware, here's what we need:

* Raspberry Pi 4 kits and boards
* 32GB-512GB microSD cards.
* HDMI cables

### Laptops / Netbooks

Modern laptop computers that meet our minimum requirements are very desirable. We are especially interested in corporate bulk donations of similar laptop models, as they help create a uniform experience in a lab.

Laptops must have the following minimum requirements:
* No major physical damage
* No missing components, including keycaps
* A working battery that accepts a charge and will power the laptop for at least 1 hour
* A working A/C power adapter that is compatible with the laptop
* A working display
* Working USB port(s)
* At least 4GB RAM
* At least 32GB hard drive


### Other

We occasionally have additional, very specific and urgent equipment needs, but those are best resolved by cash purchases at the time. Your [cash donation](donate) helps defray these unexpected expenses.

For information on where to send your donations, please email donations@kidsoncomputers.org or Contact Us with a description of what you want to donate, your location, and availability. In some cases we can provide information about major carriers that may offer discounted shipping rates.
