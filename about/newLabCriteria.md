# New Lab Criteria

Requests for new labs can be emailed to <code>board (at) kidsoncomuters.org</code>.

Please address each item listed below in your request:

### Minimum Requirements
Confirm that your request meets the following minimum requirements:

* The lab (computer classroom) is ready with adequate power and security. Please provide pictures if possible.

* There are tables to put the computers on.

* There are enough chairs for students to be seated comfortably. We typically expect to seat 2 students at 1 computer, so they can share skills and learn together.  Space at each workstation should be adequate for 2 chairs.

* Specify the number of computers being requested. We may not be able to supply all you ask for, but we'd like to understand how many could fit in the computer room.

* The sponsoring entity (e.g. school) must not require excessive school fees from students outside the norm for the area. Remember, KoC works with underprivileged kids.


### Lab/School Background
Please include the following details in your request:

* Identify a lab "sponsor". This would be a primary contact that KoC would work with to formalize the request, budget, logistics, support, etc. We prefer if this person also joins the KoC volunteer mailing list to remain involved in our work.

* Describe the number of students who will be using the lab, their ages, and level of computer skills.

* If there are existing computers already in the lab, please describe the hardware, software, and what they are being used for. (We try to provide a consistent workstation experience, so having some Windows computers with the Open Source distros provided by KoC might not be ideal.)

* Does the lab have Internet access? Most KoC labs **DO NOT** have Internet; if a lab does have access to the Internet, it may alter the software/content plan

* Describe the lab's technical support plan. Is there a teacher or administrator who is familiar with technology?  Familiar with Linux?  What about local volunteers who could support the technology needs of the lab?


### Logistical Plan
Where possible, please include answers to the following:

* Provide a list of all equipment being requested, including power cords, wifi access point (local network), power strips, power adapters, projector, etc.

* Do you have suggestions on how to get the computers to your lab? For example, we sometimes work with volunteers who travel and can carry equipment in luggage. In other cases, we may purchase used laptops locally and re-purpose with free/open source software. And, in other cases, we must ship the equipment; in this case we need to understand customs and import fees.

* How many teachers would need to be trained on using computers with free/open source software? Is there a teacher/administrator who could be the primary trainer, or will you need help from KoC volunteers?

* Do you have any resources available to partially fund the lab? For example, could you cover shipping or customs expense?


We get a lot of requests, so unfortunately we are not able to take all of them. Labs that have good answers to all of these questions, can come up with funding for shipping and have a strong local supporter get highest priority.

We are committed to helping as many kids as we can!
