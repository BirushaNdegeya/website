Other

We occasionally have additional, very specific and urgent equipment needs, but those are best resolved by cash purchases at the time. Your cash donation helps defray these unexpected expenses.

For information on where to send your donations, please email donations@kidsoncomputers.org or Contact Us with a description of what you want to donate, your location, and availability. In some cases we can provide information about major carriers that may offer discounted shipping rates.
