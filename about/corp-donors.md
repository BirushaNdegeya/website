# Corporate and Foundation Donors
Kids on Computers® has been awarded grants and has received cash and hardware donations from these organizations listed below and others. Much of what we have accomplished could not have happened without their contributions. We are extremely grateful for their generosity.


## The Linux Foundation
In 2016, The Linux Foundation made a generous donation to Kids on Computers®. The donation advanced our efforts to support access to technology, education and diversity. LF also provided free and discounted passes to Linux Foundation events for Kids on Computers® volunteers, as well as a hands-on workshop for children from the Kids on Computers® program to conduct their first Linux installation.

The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.

## Hewlett-Packard

Hewlett-Packard’s Open Source Program Office has made generous hardware donations to Kids on Computers.

## Yahoo!
Yahoo! Employee Foundation (YEF) was founded in 1999 as a philanthropic organization that brings together the talents, time, and financial resources of Yahoo! employees to serve the needs of communities around the globe. Kids on Computers is a YEF Grant recipient.

## Linux Fund
Kids on Computers at one time received a donation of several dozen laptops. They were older model laptops and, although they functioned well, they had insufficient memory (RAM) to run our chosen Linux OS efficiently. A donation from LinuxFund.org allowed us to find and purchase memory boards compatible with these older laptops. We upgraded the memory, installed Linux and our applications and the laptops were soon placed in school labs.

LinuxFund.org provides financial and administrative support to the open source community throughout the world.

## Free Geek
The memory that we installed to the older laptops mentioned above was fortunately available from Free Geek. They accept donated electronic equipment, and resell both working systems and internal components at reasonable prices.

## Pogo Linux
Pogo Linux and Micron Technology Inc. collaborated at SCALE 2016 to donate a greatly upgraded Pogo Linux Verona 931H workstation to Kids on Computers®. The powerful workstation, valued at $2600 USD, will be sold and the proceeds will go to our general fund.
