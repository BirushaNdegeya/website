# Our Labs

Since its inception in 2009, Kids on Computers has provided computers to underpiviledged kids in North America, South America, Africa, and Asia.

Most of our projects are physical computer labs set up in schools and clubs where kids gather to be educated and learn about technology. In some cases, we provide laptops and other technology for use _outside_ of lab settings (for example: laptops for college students or tablets for NGO field workers).

### History
We began in Oaxaca, Mexico where Kids on Computers founders were familiar with schools in and near Huajuapan de León.  Parents wanted improved education opportunities for their children but their economic resources did not allow funding a suitable computer lab.  The parents at one of the schools united with that school’s administration to build an addition to one of the school buildings, and Kids on Computers founders promised to fill it with a computer lab.  That computer lab came to fruition in 2009.  Other schools followed.

As of 2017, Kids on Computers® efforts have established 20+ computer labs throughout the world.  More locations are routinely being evaluated.   At some schools, the school administrators and parents have been so encouraged by results that they have independently purchased more computers for their children’s school. Please review our [New Lab Criteria](../about/new-lab-criteria) and contact us if you are interested in setting up a lab.
